    "# Tutorial 0 - Implementation of input information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit scheme\n",
    "This library aims to generate or analyze impedance vs frequency data, given\n",
    "certain information about the system. The conceptual core structure is an\n",
    "equivalent circuit scheme. It symbolizes the type and disposition of the\n",
    "passive elements that represent the physical processes which rule the\n",
    "impedance. Three (passive) elements types are considered: resistors,\n",
    "capacitors and constant phase elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any circuit can be schematized by a `string`, containing all its\n",
    "elements. And upon this aspect lies the convention used in this code to\n",
    "represent an electronic circuit. A passive element is symbolized by two\n",
    "characters: a letter for its type followed by a single-digit number\n",
    "to identify it. The convention adopted is letters `R`, `C` and `Q` for\n",
    "resisitors, capacitors and constant phase elements, respectively, while the\n",
    "numbers represent the order of apparition of the element in the string. A\n",
    "circuit string must also contain the information about the specific\n",
    "disposition of each element, where multiple elements can be in\n",
    "parallel or in series. In the string, all the elements inside a pair of round\n",
    "brackets `( )` are in series, while if they are inside a pair of square\n",
    "brackets `[ ]` they are in parallel. Obviously, the order of elements inside a\n",
    "pair of brackets is irrelevant, and usually I will write the resistors first,\n",
    "just by convention. That being said, if we take a single resistor `R1` we can\n",
    "add in serirs a capacitor `C2` just by writing `(R1C2)`.\\\n",
    "Speaking in terms of impedance, this will be equivalent to a circuit like\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"Images_tutorial/RC_series.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In similar fashion, if we want the RC parallel circuit, we\n",
    "may simply write `[R1C2]`. To go even further, a resistor that is in sereis\n",
    "with an RC parallel circuit can be written as `(R1[R2Q3])`, and so on and so\n",
    "forth. These two examples will represent these circuits (respectively)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "    <img src=\"Images_tutorial/(R1[R2Q3]).png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"385\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no whitespace is allowed in the string, and the letters are case\n",
    "sensitive (i.e. they must be capital letters). Furthermore, the code accepts\n",
    "only strings that begins with a bracket, and that of course are logically\n",
    "consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "Each element has its parameter(s) that describe it: resistors have the\n",
    "resistance $R$, the capacitance $C$ and constant phase elements (CPE) have two\n",
    "parameter: $Q$ and the ideality factor $n$. The first three must of course\n",
    "be positive, while the last one spans between 0 and 1. The interpretation of\n",
    "the constant phase element is not straightforward, but we can say that if $n$\n",
    "is close to 1 the CPE behaves like a capacitor, whether if $n$ is close to 0\n",
    "it is like a resisitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution to the impedance for each elements depends on the value of\n",
    "the parameter, since each element type is associated to an impedance formula:\n",
    "- resistor $Z = R$\n",
    "- capacitor $Z = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C}$\n",
    "- constant phase elements $Z = \\frac{1}{Q\\,(2\\pi \\omega)^n\\,e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}nj}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is the impedance and $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the set parameters must be specified inside a `list`, in base\n",
    "units, that will be treated in the code with positional consistency with the\n",
    "element number in the circuit string. This means that if we take the RC series\n",
    "circuit `(R1C2)`, where the resistor has a resistance $R = 1\\,k\\Omega$ and the\n",
    "capacitor a capacitance $C = 1\\,\\mu F$, the corresponding parameters list is\n",
    "`[1e3, 1e-6]`. Instead, if we take the circuit `(R1[R2Q3])` with\n",
    "$R1 = 110\\,\\Omega$, $R2 = 2000\\,\\Omega$ and for the CPE $Q = 10\\,\\mu F$ and\n",
    "$n = 0.5$, the parameters list is `[110, 2200, [10e-6, 0.5]]`. Thus, the\n",
    "accepted parameters type are `float`, `int` or 2-element `list` that contain\n",
    "`float` or `int`. In order to have a working code, there must be a good\n",
    "corrspondance betweem each parameter and its element in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant elements conditions\n",
    "Just for the analysis module, it is possible to set certain parameters as\n",
    "constant (i.e. will not be considered in the minimization during the fit).\\\n",
    "This because, as said before, in certain ranges of frequency, the contribution\n",
    "of some elements may be almost irrelevant, and thus it is better to just work\n",
    "with the dominant elements if we have data in a limited range. To do so,\n",
    "again, the constant condition is specified through a `list`, containing only\n",
    "`0`s and `1`s, used here in a `True` or `False` fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In similar way to the parameters list, there is the same positional\n",
    "correspondecy with the elements in the string. If the take the usual example\n",
    "`(R1C2)` and the constant condition list is `[0, 1]`, this means that only\n",
    "the parameter of the resistor will be taken into consideration during the\n",
    "miniminization. Note that the parameter of the capacitor will still contribute\n",
    "to the overall impedance function, but for the fit will be - obviously -\n",
    "constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequency and data file name settings\n",
    "In the generation file the frequency points must be specified, to state how\n",
    "many and in which frequency range the impedance data will be. In order to do\n",
    "this, the maximum and minimum must be specified, as well as the number of\n",
    "points desired.\\\n",
    "The data file name must be stated too, putting the name as a string. The\n",
    "only format considered is `.txt`.\n"
