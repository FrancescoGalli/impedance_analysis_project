    "# Tutorial 0 - Implementation of input information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration file\n",
    "All the input information must be put in the correspondant configuration file,\n",
    "organized in sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit scheme\n",
    "This library aims to generate or analyze impedance vs frequency data, given\n",
    "certain information about the system. The conceptual core structure is an\n",
    "equivalent circuit scheme. It symbolizes the type and disposition of the\n",
    "passive elements that represent the physical processes which rule the\n",
    "impedance. Three (passive) elements types are considered: resistors,\n",
    "capacitors and constant phase elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any circuit can be schematized by a `diagram`, containing all its\n",
    "elements. And upon this aspect lies the convention used in this code to\n",
    "represent an electronic circuit. A passive element is symbolized by two\n",
    "characters: a letter for its type followed by a single-digit number\n",
    "to identify it. The convention adopted is letters `R`, `C` and `Q` for\n",
    "resisitors, capacitors and constant phase elements, respectively, while the\n",
    "numbers represent the order of apparition of the element in the diagram. A\n",
    "circuit diagram must also contain the information about the specific\n",
    "disposition of each element, where multiple elements can be in\n",
    "parallel or in series. In the diagram, all the elements inside a pair of round\n",
    "brackets `( )` are in series, while if they are inside a pair of square\n",
    "brackets `[ ]` they are in parallel. Obviously, the order of elements inside a\n",
    "pair of brackets is irrelevant, and usually I will write the resistors first,\n",
    "just by convention. That being said, if we take a single resistor `R1` we can\n",
    "add in serirs a capacitor `C2` just by writing `(R1C2)`.\\\n",
    "Speaking in terms of impedance, this will be equivalent to a circuit like\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"Images_tutorial/RC_series.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In similar fashion, if we want the RC parallel circuit, we\n",
    "may simply write `[R1C2]`. To go even further, a resistor that is in sereis\n",
    "with an RC parallel circuit can be written as `(R1[R2Q3])`, and so on and so\n",
    "forth. These two examples will represent these circuits (respectively)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no whitespace is allowed in the diagram, and the letters are case\n",
    "sensitive (i.e. they must be capital letters). Furthermore, the code accepts\n",
    "only strings that begins with a bracket, and that of course are logically\n",
    "consistent.\\\n",
    "The diagram must be put in the `[Circuit]` section of the configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "Each element has its parameter(s) that describe it: resistors have the\n",
    "resistance $R$, the capacitance $C$ and constant phase elements (CPE) have two\n",
    "parameter: $Q$ and the ideality factor $n$. The first three must of course\n",
    "be positive, while the last one spans between 0 and 1. The interpretation of\n",
    "the constant phase element is not straightforward, but we can say that if $n$\n",
    "is close to 1 the CPE behaves like a capacitor, whether if $n$ is close to 0\n",
    "it is like a resisitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution to the impedance for each elements depends on the value of\n",
    "the parameter, since each element type is associated to an impedance formula:\n",
    "- resistor $Z = R$\n",
    "- capacitor $Z = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C}$\n",
    "- constant phase elements $Z = \\frac{1}{Q\\,(2\\pi \\omega)^n\\,e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}nj}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is the impedance and $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the set parameters must be specified inside `[Parameters]`\n",
    "section of the configuration file, with the name of each element's name\n",
    "followed by its value, in base units. This means that if we take the RC series\n",
    "circuit `(R1C2)`, where the resistor has a resistance $R = 1\\,k\\Omega$ and the\n",
    "capacitor a capacitance $C = 1\\,\\mu F$, the parameters will be\n",
    "\n",
    "[Parameters]\\\n",
    "R1 = 1e3\\\n",
    "C2 = 1e-6\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, if we take the circuit `(R1[R2Q3])` with $R1 = 110\\,\\Omega$,\n",
    "$R2 = 2000\\,\\Omega$ and for the CPE $Q = 10\\,\\mu F$ and $n = 0.5$, the\n",
    "configuration settings are\n",
    "\n",
    "[Parameters]\\\n",
    "R1 = 110\\\n",
    "C2 = 2200\\\n",
    "Q3 = 10e-6 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the accepted parameters are a single number for `Rs` or `Cs` or 2\n",
    "numbers separated by a whitespace for `Qs`. In order to have a working code,\n",
    "there must be a good corrspondance betweem each parameter and its element in\n",
    "the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant elements conditions\n",
    "Just for the analysis module, it is possible to set certain parameters as\n",
    "constant (i.e. will not be considered in the minimization during the fit).\\\n",
    "This because, as said before, in certain ranges of frequency, the contribution\n",
    "of some elements may be almost irrelevant, and thus it is better to just work\n",
    "with the dominant elements if we have data in a limited range. To do so,\n",
    "again, the constant condition is specified in the\n",
    "`[Constant_parameter_conditions]` through the element's name and either `0`s\n",
    "and `1`s, used here in a `True` or `False` fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the usual example `(R1C2)` and the constant conditions in the\n",
    "configuration file are\n",
    "\n",
    "[Constant_parameter_conditions]\\\n",
    "R1 = 0\\\n",
    "C2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "it means that only the parameter of the resistor will be taken into\n",
    "consideration during the miniminization. Note that the parameter of the\n",
    "capacitor will still contribute to the overall impedance function, but for\n",
    "the fit will be - obviously - constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequency and data file settings\n",
    "In the generation file the frequency points must be specified, to state how\n",
    "many and in which frequency range the impedance data will be. In order to do\n",
    "this, the maximum and minimum must be specified, as well as the number of\n",
    "points desired. In particular must be stated the order of magnitude of the \n",
    "minimum tenth power and the maximum tenth power. For example, if we take\n",
    "as minimum order of magnitude `1` and `5` as maximum, the smallest frequency\n",
    "is $10\\,Hz$ and the biggest is $100\\,kHz$\\\n",
    "The data file name must be stated as well, putting it in the `[File]` section.\n",
    "The only format considered is `.txt`. In the generation module it is also\n",
    "possible to specify the format of the data that will be saved, in the same\n",
    "section of the file's name. The only two formats accepted are either frequency\n",
    "vs complex impedance (format = 2) or frequency vs modulus and impedance\n",
    "(format = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noise seed setting\n",
    "In the generation module, a random error component is added to the signal to\n",
    "better simulated experimental impedance data. For the sake of reproducibility\n",
    "the random seed is set in the configuration file of the generation module\n"
